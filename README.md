<p align="left"># Higher-Level Programming — Python (ALX Backend)<br><br>This repository contains Python projects completed during the ALX Backend specialization track.<br><br>Starting from **Week 3 of the Backend Engineering curriculum**, each folder under this repository represents a specific Python project, task, or concept covered in the program.<br><br>The goal of this repo is to document my journey into higher-level software engineering using Python — building real backend concepts, tools and problem-solving skills.<br><br>## What This Repo Will Contain<br><br>These projects will include (but are not limited to):<br><br>* Python fundamentals & scripting<br>* Modules and import<br>* Data structures<br>* Object-Oriented Programming<br>* Exceptions & error handling<br>* File I/O<br>* Backend concepts using Python<br>* APIs, networking & integration tasks<br>* Databases & Python interactions later on<br><br>More directories will be added as I progress.<br><br>---<br><br>## Acknowledgements 🙏<br><br>All work in this repository is part of the **ALX Backend Engineering specialization** — a full-stack, project-based Software Engineering program that prepares learners for real-world development through peer learning and hands-on tasks.<br><br>---<br><br>
