# Higher-Level Programming — Python (ALX Backend)

This repository contains Python projects completed during the ALX Backend specialization track.

Starting from **Week 3 of the Backend Engineering curriculum**, each folder under this repository represents a specific Python project, task, or concept covered in the program.

The goal of this repo is to document my journey into higher-level software engineering using Python — building real backend concepts, tools and problem-solving skills.

## What This Repo Will Contain

These projects will include (but are not limited to):

- Python fundamentals & scripting
- Modules and import
- Data structures
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Exceptions & error handling
- File I/O
- Backend concepts using Python
- APIs, networking & integration tasks
- Databases & Python interactions later on

More directories will be added as I progress.

### Note

This is the *top-level* Python repository for backend-track projects — each project will be pushed as its own subfolder.
