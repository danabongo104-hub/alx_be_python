# Python - Introduction

In this directory, I begin working with basic Python syntax, variables, arithmetic operations, printing outputs, and handling user input.

These tasks introduce foundational concepts that will be used throughout backend development with Python.

## Tasks 📃

### 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise

**basic_operations.py:**  
Python script that assigns `number1 = 10` and `number2 = 5`, performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and prints the results in a readable format.

### 1. Simple Interest Calculator

**simple_interest.py:**  
Python script that calculates simple interest using `principal = 1000`, `rate = 0.05`, and `time = 3`. Prints the calculated interest.

### 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

**rectangle_area.py:**  
Python script that calculates and prints the area of a rectangle using `length = 10` and `width = 5`.

### 3. Convert Hours to Seconds

**hours_to_seconds.py:**  
Python script that converts a specific number of hours (`hours = 2`) into seconds. Prints the converted result.

### 4. User Input Age Calculator

**future_age_calculator.py:**  
Python script that asks the user for their current age and calculates how old they will be in the year 2050 (assuming the current year is 2023). Prints the age in 2050.
