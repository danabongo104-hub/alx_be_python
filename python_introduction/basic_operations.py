# Define two variables with values 10 and 5 respectively and perfom basic operations.
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Create a variable sum to hold the sum of variable1 and variable2
sum = number1 + number2
# Create a variable diff to hold the difference of variable1 and variable2
diff = number1 - number2
# Create a variable product to hold the product of variable1 and variable2.
prod = number1 * number2

#print results:
print(f"Addition of 10 and 5 is {sum}")
print(f"Subtraction of 10 and 5 is {diff}")
print(f"Multiplication of 10 and 5 is {prod}")
